	keywords = {causal learning; reinforcement learning; knowledge learning; problem solving},
	abstract = {Causal learning and reinforcement learning are both important AI learning mechanisms but are usually treated separately, despite the fact that both are directly relevant to problem solving processes. In this paper we propose a method for causal learning and problem solving, and compare and contrast that with AI reinforcement learning and show that the two methods are actually related, differing only in the values of the learning rate α and discount factor γ. However, the causal learning framework emphasizes quick but non-optimal concoction of problem solutions while AI reinforcement learning generates optimal solutions at the expense of speed. Cognitive science literature is reviewed and it is found that psychological reinforcement learning in lower form animals such as mammals is distinct from AI reinforcement learning in that psychological reinforcement learning strives neither for speed nor optimality, and that higher form animals such as humans and primates employ quick causal learning for survival instead of reinforcement learning. AI systems should likewise take advantage of a framework that employs rapid inductive causal learning to generate problem solutions for its general viability in terms of rapid adaptability, without the need to always strive for optimality.},

abstract = "Effective reinforcement learning hinges on having an appropriate state representation. But where does this representation come from? We argue that the brain discovers state representations by trying to infer the latent causal structure of the task at hand, and assigning each latent cause to a separate state. In this paper, we review several implications of this latent cause framework, with a focus on Pavlovian conditioning. The framework suggests that conditioning is not the acquisition of associations between cues and outcomes, but rather the acquisition of associations between latent causes and observable stimuli. A latent cause interpretation of conditioning enables us to begin answering questions that have frustrated classical theories: Why do extinguished responses sometimes return? Why do stimuli presented in compound sometimes summate and sometimes do not? Beyond conditioning, the principles of latent causal inference may provide a general theory of structure learning across cognitive domains."
